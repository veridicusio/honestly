ADDITIONAL TERMS UNDER SECTION 7 OF THE GNU AGPL v3
================================================================================

Pursuant to Section 7 of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3,
the following additional terms apply to this work:

1. MANDATORY ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT
   
   All copies, modifications, forks, or derivative works of this software,
   whether in source or binary form, MUST retain and prominently display
   the following attribution in all user interfaces, documentation, and
   source code files:
   
   "Based on 'honestly' by aresforblue-ai
    Original Repository: https://github.com/aresforblue-ai/honestly"
   
   This attribution must be:
   - Visible in the application's primary About page, settings page, or 
     similar prominent location where credits/licenses are typically shown
   - Included in all README files and primary documentation
   - Present in headers or comments of modified source files
   - Displayed in web interface footer, credits section, or similar 
     location where third-party attributions are shown

2. ON-CHAIN PROOF OF USAGE REQUIREMENT (for production deployments)
   
   Any entity or individual deploying this software in a production 
   environment or commercial context SHOULD (and is strongly encouraged to):
   
   a) Publish a cryptographic proof of usage on at least one of the
      following blockchain networks:
      - Ethereum Mainnet
      - Base
      - Arbitrum
   
   b) The on-chain proof MUST include:
      - A reference to this repository URL
      - The commit hash or version being used
      - A timestamp of deployment
      - The deployer's address or identifier
   
   c) The proof should be published using:
      - A smart contract that logs usage events, OR
      - An ERC-721 or ERC-1155 token with metadata referencing this work, OR
      - A permanent on-chain message or transaction with OP_RETURN data
   
   d) A link or transaction ID to the on-chain proof SHOULD be submitted
      to this repository through any of these methods:
      - A pull request to the DEPLOYMENTS.md file (if it exists), OR
      - An issue labeled "deployment-proof", OR
      - Through the repository's contact mechanisms
      
      Note: While submission is strongly encouraged for transparency and
      community awareness, the on-chain proof itself serves as the primary
      record of compliance.

3. NETWORK COPYLEFT
   
   If you run a modified version of this software on a server and allow
   users to interact with it remotely through a computer network, you must
   make the complete source code of your modified version available to
   those users under the terms of this license.

4. NO WARRANTY DISCLAIMER
   
   This software is provided "as-is" without any warranty. The authors
   and copyright holders are not liable for any damages arising from its use.

5. TERMINATION AND CURE
   
   Failure to comply with the attribution requirements constitutes a 
   violation of this license. Upon notification of violation, you have 
   30 days to cure the violation. If the violation is not cured within 
   this period, your rights under this license automatically terminate.
   
   For on-chain proof requirements, good faith efforts to comply are 
   recognized, and technical difficulties or blockchain network issues 
   provide reasonable grounds for extension of compliance timelines.
