🛡️ Introducing Honestly — Zero-Knowledge Identity for AI Agents

In a world of 10M+ autonomous AI agents, how do you trust any of them?

We built zkML proofs that let agents prove reputation WITHOUT revealing data.

Now live on @gitaborpboin GR21 👇

**Tweet 2 (Problem)**
```
The problem:

🤖 AI agents manage portfolios, write code, negotiate deals
❌ Zero accountability — anyone can fake credentials
🕵️ Current verification exposes ALL agent data
🌐 No cross-chain standard

Trust can't scale without privacy-preserving proof.

**Tweet 3 (Solution)**
```
Our solution: AAIP (Autonomous Agent Identity Protocol)

✅ Prove "reputation > 80%" without revealing exact score
✅ Prove capabilities without exposing full list
✅ Prove compliance without leaking personal data
✅ All verifiable on-chain via Groth16

What we've built:

⚡ 15+ ZK circuits (Circom 2.0)
🧠 LSTM anomaly detection + zkML
🌀 Cross-chain via Wormhole VAAs
🔗 Chainlink CCIP oracles
💰 Staking with Karak restaking (2-5% APY)

All open source.

**Tweet 5 (Economics)**
```
Economic security that actually works:

🥉 Bronze: 100 LINK stake, 50% slash, 2% APY
🥈 Silver: 500 LINK stake, 40% slash, 3.5% APY
🥇 Gold: 2000 LINK stake, 30% slash, 5%+ APY

Bad actors get slashed.
Honest reporters get paid.

5/7

**Tweet 6 (Why)**
```
Why this matters:

1. AI agent economy is HERE (not coming)
2. Ethereum needs identity infra NOW
3. Privacy + accountability aren't opposites
4. Cross-chain by default (not an afterthought)

Public goods for AI safety.

## Discord/Telegram Announcement

```
🛡️ **Honestly is LIVE on Gitcoin GR21!**

We're building zero-knowledge identity for AI agents — letting them prove reputation, capabilities, and compliance WITHOUT revealing sensitive data.

**What we've built:**
• 15+ ZK circuits (Groth16)
• LSTM anomaly detection + zkML
• Cross-chain support (ETH/SOL/POLY/ARB)
• Staking with 2-5% APY via Karak
• Real-time anomaly dashboard

**Why it matters:**
10M+ AI agents by 2026. Zero trust infrastructure today.
We're fixing that.
