# ConductMe Core

The conductor for your local AI swarm. Orchestrate multiple AI models with cryptographic proof of humanity.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## Features

- **AI Roster**: Manage your collection of AI models
- **Command Palette**: Quick search and access to all AIs
- **Visual Cards**: Beautiful UI for each AI with status indicators
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI

## Architecture

This is the frontend core of ConductMe. It connects to:
- **Trust Bridge**: Semaphore identity and ZK proof validation
- **Local AI Swarm**: Your GPU-bound models running locally
- **Honestly Backend**: For proof generation and verification

## Next Steps

1. Connect to the trust bridge for Semaphore identity
2. Add workflow/ensemble builder
3. Integrate with local AI models
4. Add cryptographic signing for all actions
