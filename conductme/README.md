# ConductMe (Private Branch Placeholder)

This folder is a placeholder for the private ConductMe app/branch. Do not commit sensitive code or credentials here in public forks. Intended contents:

- `core/` — local GPU conductor for AI agent orchestration.
- `bridge/` — Semaphore + Groth16 root-of-trust bridge components.
- `testnet/` — local-only binaries, configs, and scripts for isolated testing.

Recommended: keep this on a private branch or separate private repo; if kept here, store only stubs and documentation.
