## 🔮 Future: Option to Sell (If Needed)

### When We Might Sell

- ✅ **Community**: Need funds for grants and rewards
- ❌ **NOT for personal gain**
- ❌ **NOT for quick profit**

### How We'd Sell (If Needed)

   - Community decides via VERITAS governance
   - Transparent proposal
   - Public discussion
   - Democratic decision

2. **Transparent Process**
   - Public announcement
   - Clear use of funds
   - Regular updates
   - Community oversight

3. **Fund Usage**
   - Protocol development
   - Infrastructure scaling
   - Security audits
   - Open source grants
   - Community growth
   - **NOT personal enrichment**

4. **Sale Structure** (If Approved)
   - Small percentage of treasury
   - Fair pricing (not pump)
   - Community-first (existing holders get priority)
   - Transparent allocation

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Need to Scale Infrastructure
**Problem**: Protocol growing, need more servers/infrastructure  
**Solution**: Governance votes to sell 10% of treasury (30K VERITAS)  
**Use**: Infrastructure costs, scaling

### Scenario 2: Security Audit Needed
**Problem**: Need professional security audit before mainnet  
**Solution**: Governance votes to sell 5% of treasury (15K VERITAS)  
**Use**: Security audit costs  
**Result**: Safer protocol, more trust

### Scenario 3: Major Feature Development
**Problem**: Want to build major new feature (e.g., multi-chain expansion)  
**Solution**: Governance votes to sell 20% of treasury (60K VERITAS)  
**Use**: Development costs, hiring  
**Result**: Better protocol, more value

### Scenario 4: Personal Profit (NOT ALLOWED)
**Problem**: Team wants to cash out  
**Solution**: ❌ **NOT APPROVED** - This is greed, not mission  
**Use**: N/A  
**Result**: Would violate mission
