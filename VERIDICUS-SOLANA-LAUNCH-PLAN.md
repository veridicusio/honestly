# VERITAS Solana Launch: Master Plan

## 🎯 Mission: End-of-Month MVP → Real Quantum Firepower

**Directive**: Deploy VERITAS on Solana as SPL token. Quantum access tokenized, zkML fortified, Solana-powered.

---

## Step 1: Solidify the Core (24 Hours) ✅

### Whitepaper V2: 10-Page Beast

**Purpose**: Democratize quantum computing via aggregator model

**Use Cases**:
- Pay for IBM/Google quantum jobs
- zkML proof acceleration
- Anomaly detection with quantum ML
- Circuit optimization

**Token Flow**:
- Burns for deflation (1-5% per job based on complexity)
- Staking for priority queue
- Dynamic pricing based on provider costs

**Disclaimer**: "Not an investment—pure utility for quantum warriors."

### Tokenomics Refinement

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000 VERITAS (1M)

**Distribution**:
```
60% → Community Rewards (600K)
30% → Protocol Treasury (300K)
10% → Team - 24-month vest (100K)
```

**Dynamic Burns**: 1-5% per job based on complexity
- Simple jobs: 1% burn
- Medium jobs: 2-3% burn
- Complex jobs: 4-5% burn

**Token Standard**: Solana SPL (fungible utility token)

## Step 2: Gear Up Tech Arsenal (1-2 Days)

### Wallet Prep
- Phantom or Solflare
- Fund with 2-5 SOL (~$500)
- Auxiliary wallets for liquidity (0.5-1 SOL each)

### Dev Tools
- Solana CLI
- Rust
- Anchor framework
- Solana Cookbook

### Quantum Gateway MVP
- Rust/Anchor dApp
- Phase 1: Simulators (PennyLane for classical quantum sims)
- zkML integration (Halo2 circuits for anomaly detection)
- Token burns via smart contracts
- Job queue system

---

## Step 3: Mint & Test (3-5 Days)

### Token Creation
- SPL token via Solana CLI
- Metadata: VERITAS (VTS)
- Description: "Quantum Access Token"

### Smart Contracts
- Payment layer (burns, conversions)
- Oracle integration (Switchboard for fiat conversion)
- Job routing
- zkML hooks (on-chain verification)

### Testing
- Deploy to devnet
- Simulate 100 jobs
- Stress test for exploits
- Self-audit with Anchor testing suite

---

## Step 4: Liquidity & Fair Launch (1 Week)

### Liquidity Pool
- Raydium or Jupiter
- 20-30% supply paired to SOL/USDC
- Lock LP for 12 months (Team Finance)

### Anti-Snipe Shields
- Bot-resistant tools (Pump.fun or custom)
- Gradual unlocks
- No presales

### Launch Mechanics
- Airdrop to 500 zkML/Solana devs (Merkle proofs)
- Announce on X/Discord
- Time for Solana surge
- Wallet integration

---

## Step 5: Post-Launch Domination (Ongoing)

### Monitoring
- Dune Analytics dashboards
- Auto-airdrops at milestones
- Burn/job/holder tracking

### Phase 2 Ramp
- Week 2: IBM API integration
- Gateway converts VERITAS to fiat
- zkML anomaly bots on Solana

### Growth Hacks
- Bounty program for community nodes
- Partner with IonQ/Amazon
- Enterprise quantum deals

### Risk Shields
- Monitor for dumps
- Treasury for buybacks
- Legal disclaimers everywhere
