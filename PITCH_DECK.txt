================================================================================


SLIDE 1: COVER
================================================================================

HONESTLY

Cryptographic Passports for AI Agents

AI Agent Identity Protocol (AAIP)


SLIDE 2: ELEVATOR PITCH
================================================================================

"We built cryptographic passports for AI agents - the first zero-knowledge
identity protocol that proves an agent's reputation and capabilities without
revealing its secrets."


SLIDE 3: THE PROBLEM
================================================================================

THE PROBLEM

AI agents are proliferating everywhere - trading crypto, writing code,
managing infrastructure.

But there's NO WAY TO VERIFY if an agent is who it claims to be or if
it's trustworthy.

• Anyone can claim to be "Claude" or "GPT-4"
• No cryptographic proof of reputation
• No verification of capabilities
• Massive security risk as agents interact with APIs, blockchains, money


SLIDE 4: MARKET URGENCY
================================================================================

WHY NOW?

80K+
LangChain GitHub Stars
(millions of deployments)

$1B+
Lost to AI-powered
crypto scams in 2024

2025
EU AI Act requires
AI system identification

→ Regulation + billion-dollar fraud = urgent demand for verifiable AI identity


SLIDE 5: THE SOLUTION
================================================================================

OUR SOLUTION: AAIP
AI Agent Identity Protocol

🔐 W3C DIDs
Standards-compliant identity: did:honestly:agent:claude-opus

🎭 ZK PROOFS
Prove reputation > threshold without revealing actual score (Groth16 ZK-SNARKs)

✅ CAPABILITY VERIFICATION
Cryptographically prove what an agent can do without exposing architecture

🛡️ REPLAY PREVENTION
Redis-backed nullifier tracking - each proof is unique and non-reusable


SLIDE 6: HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

HOW IT WORKS

# 1. Register AI agent
agent = register_ai_agent(
  name="claude-opus",
  capabilities=["reasoning", "code_gen"]
)
# Returns: did:honestly:agent:claude-opus

# 2. Generate ZK proof of reputation
proof = get_agent_reputation(
  agent_id="claude-opus",
  threshold=40  # Prove > 40 without revealing score
)

# 3. Verify the proof
verify_zk_proof(proof)
# Returns: {"verified": true, "nullifier_valid": true}

→ Real Groth16 ZK-SNARKs, not simulations. Production-ready cryptography.


SLIDE 7: TECHNICAL INNOVATION
================================================================================

TECHNICAL INNOVATION

First production implementation of zero-knowledge proofs for AI agent
authentication

• NOVEL ZK CIRCUIT: Level3Inequality.circom for reputation threshold proofs
• IDENTITY BINDING: Poseidon hashing prevents proof forgery
• STANDARDS COMPLIANT: W3C DIDs + Verifiable Credentials
• PRODUCTION CRYPTOGRAPHY: Groth16 (same as Ethereum ZK rollups)
• REPLAY PROTECTION: Nullifier tracking with Redis persistence

We extended standard ZK-SNARK circuits (age verification) to AI agent
reputation - a novel contribution.

APPENDIX: ONE-LINE PITCH
================================================================================

"We built cryptographic passports for AI agents - the first zero-knowledge
identity protocol that proves an agent's reputation and capabilities without
revealing its secrets."


APPENDIX: PARAGRAPH BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

Honestly is the first production-ready identity infrastructure for AI agents
using zero-knowledge cryptography. As autonomous AI agents proliferate across
crypto trading, code generation, and API orchestration, there's no way to
verify if an agent is who it claims to be or if it's trustworthy. We solved
this with AAIP (AI Agent Identity Protocol) - agents get W3C-compliant DIDs
(like did:honestly:agent:claude-opus), generate Groth16 ZK-SNARK proofs of
reputation thresholds without revealing actual scores, and prove capabilities
without exposing proprietary architectures. We prevent replay attacks with
Redis-backed nullifier tracking and provide cryptographic signatures for
authentication. This isn't a whitepaper - we have 13,000 lines of production
code, real ZK circuits, and are ready to integrate with LangChain, AutoGPT,
and every major AI framework. We're building the missing trust layer for the
AI agent economy, exactly when regulation (EU AI Act, NIST frameworks) and
billion-dollar fraud risks make it critical. Think of it as HTTPS for AI
agents - the infrastructure that makes autonomous systems trustworthy by
default.
