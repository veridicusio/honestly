## 🔥 Token Utility & Value Drivers

### Primary Utility: Quantum Compute Access

**Dynamic Burn Mechanism**:
- **Base**: 1 VERITAS per job
- **Variable**: Based on qubits
  - 5-qubit sim: +1 VERITAS (total: 2)
  - 10-qubit sim: +2 VERITAS (total: 3)
  - 20-qubit sim: +5 VERITAS (total: 6)
  - Real hardware: +10 VERITAS (total: 11+)

**zkML Integration**:
- Quantum-optimized circuits for anomaly detection
- Spot Solana rugs 10x faster
- Burn VERITAS for quantum-accelerated proofs

### Secondary Utility: Fee Discounts

**Staking Tiers**:
- **1K VERITAS staked**: 20% off job fees
- **5K VERITAS staked**: 40% off job fees
- **20K VERITAS staked**: 60% off job fees

**Stacks with governance perks** - Combined benefits

### Governance: Quadratic Voting

**Staked VERITAS for voting power**:
- Vote on provider additions
- Phase 4 node rules
- Treasury allocations
- Protocol upgrades

**Quadratic model**: Prevents whale dominance

### Staking Rewards (Phase 3)

**Yield from treasury fees**:
- **5% APY in VERITAS**
- Rewarded for running zkML validators
- Community node operators earn 70% of fees

## 📈 Value Drivers: The Irreplaceable Hook

### 1. Deflation via Burns

**Creates scarcity**:
- Year 1 projection: ~10K burned (100 daily jobs, 5% growth)
- Year 2 projection: ~50K burned (viral zkML alerts)
- **Dynamic burn rates**: 2-5% per job (higher for real hardware)

**Oracle-Pegged**:
- Burn rates pegged to SOL/USD for stability
- Prevents manipulation

### 2. Demand Spikes

**Quantum adoption projected 10x growth by 2026**:
- More quantum jobs = more burns
- Scarcity increases with usage
- Value appreciation follows

### 3. Network Effects

**More providers = cheaper jobs = more users**:
- Multi-provider aggregation reduces costs
- Lower costs attract more users
- More users = more burns = tighter supply

**zkML Integration Loops**:
- Detect anomalies → Earn VERITAS bounties
- Burn VERITAS → Quantum upgrades
- Better detection → More rewards → More burns

### 4. Dynamic Pricing

**On-chain auctions for premium slots**:
- Peak demand periods
- Highest VERITAS bidder wins
- Creates additional burn pressure

---

## 💸 Economic Model: Deflationary War Machine

### Deflationary Mechanism

**2-5% burn per job** (dynamic based on hardware type):
- Simulators: 2% burn
- Real hardware: 5% burn
- Complex jobs: Up to 5% burn

**Oracle-Pegged Stability**:
- Burn rates adjust to SOL/USD
- Prevents manipulation
- Maintains stability

### Value Accrual

**Utility demand funnels to treasury**:
- **10% fee skim** from all jobs
- Fees fund buy/burns
- Treasury grows with usage

**Buy/Burn Mechanism**:
- Treasury uses fees to buy VERITAS
- Burns purchased tokens
- Accelerates deflation

### Network Effects

**zkML Integration Creates Loops**:
1. Detect anomalies → Earn VERITAS bounties
2. Burn VERITAS → Quantum upgrades
3. Better detection → More rewards
4. More rewards → More burns
5. Cycle repeats
