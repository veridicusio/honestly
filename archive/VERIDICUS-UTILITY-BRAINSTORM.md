# VERITAS Token Utility - Brainstorm

## 🎯 Goal: Maximum Utility That Nobody Has Thought Of

**Current Standard Utilities** (we can do better):
- ❌ Governance voting (everyone does this)
- ❌ Fee discounts (boring)
- ❌ Staking rewards (generic)
- ❌ Revenue sharing (common)

## 💡 Framework for Unique Utility

### Think About:
1. **What problem does VERITAS solve uniquely?**
   - AI agent verification
   - Cross-chain anomaly detection
   - Trust in AI systems

2. **What can VERITAS do that other tokens can't?**
   - Tied to AI agent identity
   - Linked to anomaly detection
   - Cross-chain reputation

3. **What would make VERITAS irreplaceable?**
   - Something only VERITAS can do
   - Something that gets more valuable with use
   - Something that creates network effects

## 🔮 Potential Unique Utilities (Starting Points)

### 1. **AI Agent Reputation Bonding**
- VERITAS acts as a "reputation bond" for AI agents
- Agents stake VERITAS to prove they're trustworthy
- More VERITAS staked = higher trust score
- Unique: Directly tied to AI agent identity

### 2. **Anomaly Detection Credits**
- VERITAS required to run anomaly detection
- Each detection costs X VERITAS
- Creates demand as more agents are verified
- Unique: Utility tied to core protocol function

### 3. **Cross-Chain Reputation Portability**
- VERITAS represents reputation across all chains
- Your reputation follows you via VERITAS balance
- Unique: First cross-chain reputation token

### 4. **Proof-of-Honesty Mining**
- Earn VERITAS by proving AI agents are honest
- Reporters get VERITAS for accurate reports
- Creates incentive for truth-telling
- Unique: Rewards honesty, not speculation

### 5. **Agent Identity Minting**
- Need VERITAS to mint new AI agent identities
- Creates scarcity and value
- Unique: Required for protocol participation

### 6. **Reputation Insurance Pool**
- Stake VERITAS in insurance pool
- If agent misbehaves, pool pays out
- Unique: Decentralized insurance for AI

### 7. **Circuit Access Token**
- VERITAS required to use zkML circuits
- Each proof costs VERITAS
- Creates sustainable demand
- Unique: Pay-per-proof model

### 8. **Agent Marketplace Currency**
- VERITAS used to buy/sell verified agents
- Reputation as tradeable asset
- Unique: First AI agent marketplace

Think about:
- What would make VERITAS essential?
- What can only VERITAS do?
- What creates real, sustainable demand?
- What helps people verify AI agents?
