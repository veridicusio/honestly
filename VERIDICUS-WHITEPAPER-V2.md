# VERITAS Whitepaper V2
## Quantum Access Token - Democratizing Quantum Computing

**Version**: 2.0  
**Date**: December 2025  
**Disclaimer**: VERITAS is a utility token, not an investment. Pure utility for quantum warriors.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

VERITAS is the first cryptocurrency token to provide on-demand access to quantum computing resources. By aggregating existing quantum cloud providers (IBM, Google, IonQ, Amazon Braket) and offering a crypto-native payment mechanism, VERITAS democratizes quantum computing for developers, researchers, and innovators.

**Key Innovation**: Tokenized quantum compute access via burn mechanism, integrated with zkML for verifiable AI agent anomaly detection.

---

## 2. The Problem

### Quantum Computing is Inaccessible

- **High Barriers**: Quantum hardware costs millions, requires specialized knowledge
- **Centralized Access**: Only large corporations and research institutions can afford it
- **Complex Payment**: Credit cards, bank accounts, geographic restrictions
- **No Crypto Integration**: No way to pay with cryptocurrency

### AI Agent Verification Needs Quantum Power

- **zkML Proofs**: Require massive computation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Needs quantum ML for accuracy
- **Circuit Optimization**: Quantum algorithms can optimize classical circuits
- **Security Audits**: Quantum-resistant cryptography requires quantum analysis

---

## 3. The Solution: VERITAS Quantum Gateway

### Aggregator Model

**We don't build quantum hardware. We provide the access layer.**

VERITAS aggregates existing quantum cloud providers:
- IBM Quantum Network
- Google Quantum AI
- IonQ Cloud
- Amazon Braket
- Rigetti Computing

### Crypto-Native Payment

- **Pay with VERITAS**: No credit cards, no banks
- **Global Access**: No geographic restrictions
- **Instant Settlement**: Blockchain-native payments
- **Deflationary**: Tokens burned on use

### zkML Integration

- **Quantum-Accelerated Proofs**: 10x faster zkML generation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Quantum ML for better accuracy
- **Circuit Optimization**: Quantum algorithms optimize Circom circuits
- **On-Chain Verification**: zkML proofs verified on-chain

---

## 4. Use Cases

### 4.1 zkML Proof Acceleration

**Problem**: zkML proofs take hours on classical computers  
**Solution**: Quantum acceleration reduces time by 10x

**Cost**: 10 VERITAS per proof  
**Burn Rate**: 2% (medium complexity)

### 4.2 Circuit Optimization

**Problem**: Circom circuits are large and slow  
**Solution**: Quantum algorithms optimize circuit structure

**Cost**: 5 VERITAS per optimization  
**Burn Rate**: 1% (simple complexity)

### 4.3 Anomaly Detection

**Problem**: Classical ML misses subtle anomalies  
**Solution**: Quantum ML detects patterns classical ML can't

**Cost**: 20 VERITAS per detection  
**Burn Rate**: 3% (medium complexity)

### 4.4 Security Audits

**Problem**: Future quantum computers break current crypto  
**Solution**: Quantum security analysis future-proofs protocols

**Cost**: 50 VERITAS per audit  
**Burn Rate**: 5% (complex job)

---

## 5. Token Flow & Economics

### 5.1 Burn Mechanism

**Dynamic Burns**: 1-5% per job based on complexity

```
User pays VERITAS → Burned (deflationary)
    ↓
Gateway converts to USD → Pays quantum provider
    ↓
Quantum job executed
    ↓
Results returned to user
```

**Burn Rates**:
- Simple jobs (circuit optimization): 1%
- Medium jobs (zkML proofs, anomaly detection): 2-3%
- Complex jobs (security audits): 4-5%

### 5.2 Staking for Priority

**Stake VERITAS** to get priority in job queue:
- Standard: No staking required
- High Priority: 1,000 VERITAS staked
- VIP: 10,000 VERITAS staked

**Staking Rewards**: Earn yield on staked tokens (future)

### 5.3 Value Accrual

1. **Utility Demand**: More jobs = more burns = scarcity
2. **Network Effects**: More users = more value
3. **Governance**: Control protocol direction
4. **Deflationary Pressure**: Burns reduce supply over time
