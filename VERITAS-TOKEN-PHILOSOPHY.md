# VERITAS Token Philosophy

> **Validated by Grok**: "This revised approach as a Quantum Cloud Aggregator significantly boosts the plausibility of launching VERITAS on Solana in the near term (2025 phases). By shifting away from hardware development to an access layer, you're leveraging mature quantum cloud infrastructure while adding a crypto-native payment and abstraction mechanism—making it more feasible technically, economically, and regulatorily."

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. **No Greed, Just Help**
- ❌ No public sale
- ❌ No speculation games
- ❌ No pump & dump
- ✅ Pure utility token
- ✅ Help people verify AI agents
- ✅ Support open source ecosystem

### 2. **Open Source First**
- ✅ Fully open source
- ✅ Community-driven
- ✅ Transparent distribution
- ✅ No hidden allocations
- ✅ Public treasury

### 3. **Small Supply, Big Impact**
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 VERITAS (1M)
- **Why Small?**
  - Focus on quality, not quantity
  - Each token has real utility
  - No inflation games
  - Sustainable, not speculative

### 4. **Distribution Philosophy**

```
600K → Community (60%)

  - Contributors who improve the protocol
  - Oracle nodes that secure the network
  - People who help others use it

300K → Treasury (30%)
  - Open source grants
  - Security audits
  - Development & maintenance
  - Educational content

100K → Team (10%)
  - Long vesting (4 years)
  - Mission-aligned only
  - No early unlocks
```
