# Phase 4 Decision Summary ✅

## 🎯 Economic Model Decision

**✅ APPROVED: LINK-Only for Phase 4**

- **Staking**: Users stake LINK (100-2000 LINK)
- **Rewards**: Paid in LINK from slash pool
- **Slashing**: LINK burned/slashed
- **No Native Token**: Keep it simple, ship fast

## 🪙 Future Token: VERITAS

**When we add a token later, it will be called VERITAS**

- **Protocol Name**: Honestly (project/platform)
- **Token Name**: VERITAS (governance/utility)
- **Current Staking**: LINK (Chainlink token)
- **Token Supply**: 1,000,000 VERITAS (1M - small, focused)
- **Philosophy**: No initial sale, mission-driven, help people
- **Future**: Option to sell if needed for growth (governance decides)
- **Goal**: Change the world, not just make money
- **Distribution**: Community rewards, open source grants, treasury

### Why VERITAS?
- "Veritas" = Truth in Latin
- Fits the "honest" AI agent theme
- Corporate name "Honestly" is taken
- VERITAS can be the token/DAO name

## 📋 Implementation Status

### Phase 4.0 (Current)
- ✅ LINK-only staking (implemented)
- ✅ No token minting
- ✅ Focus on tech, not tokenomics

### Phase 4.5 (Future)
- ⏳ Add VERITAS governance token (1M supply)
- ⏳ Use for voting on protocol parameters
- ⏳ Community rewards (no initial sale)
- ⏳ Open source grants from treasury
- ⏳ Mission-driven, not profit-driven
- ⏳ Option to sell later if needed for growth (governance decides)

### Phase 5.0 (Future)
- ⏳ Full dual token model
- ⏳ VERITAS staking for protocol benefits
- ⏳ LINK still required for anomaly reporting

## 🎉 Ready to Ship!

**Current contracts use LINK only** - no changes needed.  
**Future VERITAS token** - will be added later when we need governance/value capture.
