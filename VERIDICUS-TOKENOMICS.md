# VERITAS Tokenomics: Complete Economic Model

> **⚠️ UPDATED**: See `VERITAS-TOKENOMICS-REFINED.md` for the latest Grok-validated tokenomics with vesting teeth, dynamic burns, and Token-2022 standard.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Mission-Driven Token**: Change the world, not just make money.

### Principles
1. **No Greed** - Help people verify AI agents
2. **Open Source First** - Community-driven development
3. **Small Supply, Big Impact** - 1M tokens, focused distribution
4. **Utility-First** - Real quantum compute access, not speculation

## 💰 Token Utility & Value Drivers

### Primary Utility: Quantum Computing Access

**VERITAS is the first token to offer real quantum compute access**

#### Use Cases
1. **zkML Proof Acceleration** (10 VERITAS)
   - 10x faster proof generation
   - Quantum-optimized circuits
   - Better accuracy

2. **Circuit Optimization** (5 VERITAS)
   - Optimize Circom circuits
   - Reduce proof size
   - Improve performance

3. **Anomaly Detection** (20 VERITAS)
   - Quantum ML for better detection
   - Enhanced accuracy
   - Faster processing

4. **Security Audits** (50 VERITAS)
   - Quantum security analysis
   - Future-proof cryptography
   - Advanced threat detection

### Secondary Utility: Protocol Benefits

#### 1. Fee Discounts
Hold VERITAS to get discounts on protocol fees:

| VERITAS Balance | Discount |
|----------------|----------|
| 1,000+ | 10% |
| 5,000+ | 25% |
| 20,000+ | 50% |

#### 2. Governance Voting
- Vote on protocol upgrades
- Propose new features
- Decide on treasury allocation
- Future sale decisions (if needed)

#### 3. Staking Rewards (Future)
- Stake VERITAS for priority quantum jobs
- Earn yield on idle stakes
- Support network security

## 🔄 Token Flow & Economics

### Deflationary Mechanism

**VERITAS is burned when used for quantum compute**

```
User pays VERITAS → Burned (deflationary)
    ↓
Gateway converts to USD → Pays quantum provider
    ↓
Quantum job executed
    ↓
Results returned to user
```

**Burn Rate**:
- Initial: ~1,000 VERITAS/month (estimated)
- Growth: Scales with usage
- Long-term: Deflationary pressure increases value

### Value Accrual

1. **Utility Demand**
   - More quantum jobs = more VERITAS burned
   - Scarcity increases as supply decreases
   - Value increases with usage

2. **Network Effects**
   - More users = more value
   - More providers = better service
   - More developers = more features

3. **Governance Value**
   - Control over protocol direction
   - Treasury allocation decisions
   - Future development priorities

## 📈 Economic Model

### Pricing Model

**Dynamic pricing based on:**
- VERITAS/USD exchange rate
- Quantum provider costs
- Job complexity
- Network demand

**Base Pricing** (example):
| Job Type | VERITAS | USD Equivalent |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| zkML Proof | 10 | $1.00 |
| Circuit Optimize | 5 | $0.50 |
| Anomaly Detect | 20 | $2.00 |
| Security Audit | 50 | $5.00 |

**Note**: Pricing adjusts automatically based on market conditions.

### Revenue Model

**Phase 1: No Revenue (Community-First)**
- All VERITAS goes to community
- Treasury funds operations
- No fees or profit-taking

**Phase 2: Sustainable Operations (Future)**
- Small protocol fee (5-10%)
- Funds treasury for operations
- Remaining to community

**Phase 3: Decentralized (Long-Term)**
- Community nodes earn VERITAS
- Self-sustaining economy
- Governance-driven decisions
